# Introduction
The objective of this project was to perform a comaprative analysis of scheduling algorithms in HADOOP and suggest an improvement for their shortcomings.<br/>
Also demonstrated working of Hadoop with MapReduce in pseudo distributedmode.<br/>

# Scheduling Algorithms used:
<ul>
<li>Data-Locality Aware</li>
<li>Workload Characteristic Oriented</li>
<li>Job Aware</li>
<li>Deadline Aware</li>
</ul>
